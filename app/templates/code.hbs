    <h2>the code journey</h2>

    <p>
      About a year from now I was reflecting on the career path I had chosen.
      I worked hard and yet my merit felt empty. I was looking for a challenge that
      would excite me day and night. A friend of mine recommended
      I look into coding programs. I started off by taking night courses at Davinci with
      Jason Nobel as our instructor. After taking three months of nightly courses I was awakened by
      this new obsession to become a developer. However, this wasn't enough, I realized that in order to
      fully submerse myself into this culture I need to find more time for this newly found passion of mine.
      I decided to work 6 months to raise enough finances for gSchool. I am about three months into the
      gSchool program. Our instructors Jeff Dean and Aaron Gray are incredible. Becoming part of this dev community has
      been one of the best decision of my life. I can't wait to passionately code for my future employer.
